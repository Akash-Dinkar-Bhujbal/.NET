    - Create list without Initializer
    - Create list with Initializer
    - Check specific element is present or not : using for loop
    - String.Join(",", list.ToArray) :List of String -->Return String Array
    - Add(value): insert at last
    - Insert(index, value) insert at specific index
    - New List(Of Integer)({val1, val2}): Initial list
    - InsertRange(0, New Integer() {val1, val2}):Insert ints at the start

## VB2_add 
- Importing & Calling <b>VB_Add</b> class library


## NOTES
<!--- DIM : Determine VARIABLES'S DATA TYPE
- Small changes in .net framework using C# over simple C# lang
    - No semicolon(;) 
    - No curly brackets/ braces
    - End keyword use for ending curly braces-->

### Difference between VB.NET and C# :

|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pronunciation            | It is pronounced as Visual Basic  .NET.                                                   | It is pronounced as C-Sharp.                                                              |
| Belonging                | It is an updated version of Classic Visual Basic 6.0.                                     | It belongs to the C family and it is evolved from C.                                      |
| Variable Declaration     | Variables are declared using keywords such as Private, Protected, Friend and Static, etc. | Variables are declared using declarations.                                                |
| Object Creation          | The object is created using New and Create Object().                                      | The object can be created using New.                                                      |
| Object Initialization    | In this, Sub New() is used to initialize, uses a newly created object.                    | In this, constructors are used to initialize the object.                                  |
| Class Declaration        |  In VB.NET declare a class by using Class <implementation> keyword.                       | In C# declare a class by using the Class keyword.                                         |
| Hiding                   |  This feature will not be supported in VB. NET.                                           | This feature is supported by C#.                                                          |

| Background Compilation        | In VB.NET background compilation takes place continuously for every valid statement.                                          | Visual Basic is an interpreted language in this each statement is interpreted at a time to be converted into object code, then into source code so there is no background compilation. |
| Runtime Environment           | VB.NET uses the Common Language Runtime environment.                                                                          | Visual Basic uses the common Visual Basic Runtime environment.                                                                                                                         |

| Short Circuit Logic           | In VB.NET, Short Circuit Logic is available.                                                                                  | In Visual Basic, there is no concept of Short Circuit Logic.                                                                                                                           |
| Application Development       | In VB.NET we can create different types of applications such as console applications, web applications, windows applications. | Visual Basic is not versatile for creating different types of applications.                                                                                                            |
